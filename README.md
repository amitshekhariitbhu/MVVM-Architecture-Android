# MVP template

When we follow any architecture pattern like MVP, MVVM, MVP clean, we always come across a small but repetitive task to create basic files like Android Activity, Presenter, View, Api models and then writing boiler plate code. This usually takes 1-2 hours for each single screen. To ease out work and save time We have created an automated template which will do above work in less than 20 seconds.

### How to Install

Find the template/MVPActivity folder under root directory of android-mvp-architecture app. Paste the MVPActivity folder at below location.
1. Windows - C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\plugins\android\lib\templates\activities
2. Mac - /Applications/Android/Studio.app/Contents/plugins/android/lib/templates/activities

Restart the Android Studio.

### How to use

Select the folder under which you want to create a new MVP folder. This MVP folder will contain Activity, Presenter, MVpPresenter and View class. For example, to create a new MVP folder under “view” folder, do as shown below.
